The procedure will be different depending on the marketplace you choose to buy ALEX tokens. However, if you decide to use the [Alex Lab](https://app.alexlab.co/swap) platform (the last option on the list), you can follow these detailed guides, which use the ALEX token as an example of how to perform a swap:

1. First, connect your wallet. You can follow this step-by-step guide: 
[How to connect your wallet](https://docs.alexlab.co/getting-started/how-to-connect-your-wallet)

2. Next, depending on which blockchain you are using, follow the appropriate path to obtain ALEX tokens:
- If you're a Bitcoin user: Use the Bitcoin Native Swap to get ALEX BRC-20 or Runes through Bitcoin Native Swap.

### Move ALEX Across Different Chains

It is also possible, to use [Brotocol](https://brotocol.xyz/about) to bridge ALEX across different blockchains, in case you hold ALEX on another chain and want to transfer it to another one (for example, to Stacks), as shown below.
