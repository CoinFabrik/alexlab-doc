# ⚡ DAMM: Discrete Automated Market Maker

**DAMM** (Discrete Automated Market Maker) is the next-generation liquidity engine on ALEX DEX. It brings **concentrated liquidity** to Stacks by introducing **price bins** and **virtual balances**, giving liquidity providers (LPs) tighter control over how their funds are deployed.

Unlike traditional AMMs, DAMM allows users to provide liquidity to specific price ranges (bins), concentrating capital where it’s most likely to be used. This improves capital efficiency and gives LPs more control over their positions.

To learn about the math and architecture behind DAMM, check out the detailed breakdown on [our Medium post](https://medium.com/alexgobtc/damm-alex-amm-v3-discrete-automated-market-maker-fa6b2926a69b).

## ✅ What Can You Do with DAMM?

🔸 **Add liquidity to specific price ranges** — instead of spreading it across the full curve  
🔸 **Enjoy smoother trades** — virtual balances help reduce slippage  
🔸 **Adjust your positions anytime** — add or remove just a portion if you want  
🔸 **Each pool has its own fee setup** — defined when it's created by the DAO
