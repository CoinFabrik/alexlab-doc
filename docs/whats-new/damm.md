# ‚ö° DAMM: Discrete Automated Market Maker

**DAMM** (Discrete Automated Market Maker) is the next-generation liquidity engine on ALEX DEX. It brings **concentrated liquidity** to Stacks by introducing **price bins** and **virtual balances**, giving liquidity providers (LPs) tighter control over how their funds are deployed.

Unlike traditional AMMs, DAMM allows users to provide liquidity to specific price ranges (bins), concentrating capital where it‚Äôs most likely to be used. This improves capital efficiency and gives LPs more control over their positions.

To learn about the math and architecture behind DAMM, check out the detailed breakdown on [our Medium post](https://medium.com/alexgobtc/damm-alex-amm-v3-discrete-automated-market-maker-fa6b2926a69b).

## ‚úÖ What Can You Do with DAMM?

**üî∏ Discrete Liquidity Bins**  
LPs no longer need to spread their liquidity across the entire price curve. Instead, they can choose specific ‚Äúbins‚Äù (price ranges where they expect trading to occur). This lets them use their capital more efficiently by focusing it where it's most likely to be used.

**üî∏ Virtual Balances (Smoother Price Curves)**  
DAMM introduces virtual balances, which are essentially imaginary tokens added to each bin‚Äôs reserves to help shape the price curve. Even when liquidity is focused in specific bins, virtual balances help smooth out price changes. This means more stable prices for traders and a better overall experience without affecting how LPs manage their positions.

**üî∏ Improved Position Management**  
LPs can update their positions at any time by adding or removing a portion of their liquidity. The protocol supports batch actions, so instead of managing each price bin individually, LPs can add liquidity to multiple bins in one go or reduce all of them by a set percentage in a single step. This makes it easier to adjust to the market or manage exposure without needing to withdraw everything.

**üî∏ Flexible Fee Structure with LP Incentives**  
Each pool on DAMM can set its own trading fees when it‚Äôs created. These fees can be configured separately for each token in the pair, meaning the cost of swapping from Token X to Token Y can differ from the opposite direction. A portion of the collected fees can also be given back to LPs as extra rewards, helping attract and retain liquidity more effectively.

**üî∏ Advanced Swap Mechanics (IOC/FOK Orders and More)**  
DAMM preserves the simple experience of swapping tokens with a slippage setting, but also adds advanced features like Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC) and, in the future, Fill-or-Kill (FOK). These tools give traders more control over execution, helping avoid bad fills and improving trade precision.
