# :man_dancing: Permissionless Pool Creation

The **Permissionless Token Listing** feature enables anyone to create a liquidity pool with instant verification of token contract's safetyâ€”**no delays, no intermediaries.**

Built on top of Marvin Janssen's latest work, [clarity-stacks](https://github.com/MarvinJanssen/clarity-stacks) library lets developers to prove whether a deployed contract matches a specific codebase.

Now, there is no need to rely on an off-chain deployer or manually verify a token's contract safety. No additional processes or manual approvals are required, streamlining the listing process on Stacks like never before.
