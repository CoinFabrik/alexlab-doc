<summary>Why should I use the ALEX Bitcoin Native Swap instead of performing the operations myself?</summary>

The Bitcoin Native Swap on ALEX simplifies the process of swapping tokens, since it performs the swap in one simple operation instead of requiring you to interact with multiple wallets, networks, or contracts. The main benefit of the **Bitcoin Native Swap** on ALEX is that it ensures you won't miss the chance of executing a transaction at your desired exchange rate. Since the swap is performed automatically, you don't have to worry about price fluctuations that may occur if you perform the operation manually.

<summary>Why are my tokens being converted to other tokens before being swapped for my target token?</summary>

The ALEX Bitcoin Native Swap may use intermediate tokens to complete the exchange because it is designed to find the most optimal route for the swap. Sometimes fees are lower between some token pairs over others or your rate can be improved by splitting the swap into smaller steps. The route, as well as the fee, will always be displayed before your transaction is confirmed.

<summary>How are swaps and liquidity pools related?</summary>

When you perform a swap on ALEX, you are interacting with liquidity pools. Each pool contains two tokens, which makes it possible to exchange one for the other. Besides, the exchange rate of the swap is determined by the price of the tokens in the pool via an Automated Market Maker (AMM).

<summary>What is the difference between a swap fee and a liquidity provider fee?</summary>

The liquidity provider fee is the amount paid by the user to the liquidity providers of the pool that is being used for the swap. The swap fee, in this case, refers to the fee that is being distributed to the ALEX Lab Platform for facillitating the exchange.
