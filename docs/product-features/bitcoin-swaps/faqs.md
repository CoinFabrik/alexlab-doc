Why should I use the ALEX Bitcoin Native Swap instead of performing the operations myself?
The Bitcoin Native Swap on ALEX simplifies the process of swapping tokens, since it performs the swap in one simple operation instead of requiring you to interact with multiple wallets, networks, or contracts. ALEX’s optimization algorithms reduce unnecessary fees and improve the overall value of your swap.

Will my fees be lower or higher?
Fees depend on many variables, such as transaction size, pool liquidity and network congestion. The Bitcoin Native Swap finds the most cost-effective route for your transaction, by searching for the pools with the most liquidity (and lower fees) or performing intermediate swaps with other tokens. However, there are edge cases where fees may be slightly higher than in a manual operation—for example, if network fees drop within the extra minutes it would have taken the user to perform the operation manually. Either way, the fees will always be displayed in the transaction Details panel.

Why are my tokens being converted to other tokens in the Route?
The ALEX Bitcoin Native Swap may use intermediate tokens to complete the exchange because it is designed to find the most optimal route for the swap. Sometimes fees are lower between some token pairs over others or your rate can be improved by splitting the swap into smaller steps. The route, as well as the fee, will always be displayed before your transaction is confirmed.

How are swaps and liquidity pools related?
When you perform a swap on ALEX, you interact directly with a liquidity pool. The pool contains two tokens, which makes it possible to exchange one for the other. Besides, the exchange rate of the swap is determined by the price of the tokens in the pool via an Automated Market Maker (AMM). 

What is the difference between a swap fee and a liquidity provider fee?
The liquidity provider fee is the amount paid by the user to the LPs of the liquidity pool that is being used for the swap. The swap fee, in this case, refers to the fee that is being distributed to the ALEX Lab Platform for facillitating the exchange.
