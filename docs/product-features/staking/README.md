# âš“ Stake

Stake your ALEX tokens and start earning rewards!

ALEX staking involves "locking up" your ALEX tokens on the platform for an amount of time, measured in cycles, in exchange for protocol rewards.

You can think of $ALEX staking as depositing money into an interest-earning account: the longer you keep the money in the account, the more interest you earn.&#x20;

Similarly, the longer you stake $ALEX, the more rewards you earn. The protocol rewards are provided in the form of more $ALEX and APower tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is APower?** APower is the lottery ticket that allows you to take part in any future IDO rounds on our Launchpad. It is a non-transferrable and non-tradable token that is earned by staking.

ALEX provides two different forms of staking to suit every user's need.

* [**Manual Staking**](https://coinfabrik.gitbook.io/alexlab-doc/stake/features/staking/key-concepts#manual-staking): Stake $ALEX directly on the [ALEX Lab Platform](https://app.alexlab.co/stake).
* [**Liquid Staking**](https://coinfabrik.gitbook.io/alexlab-doc/stake/features/staking/key-concepts#liquid-staking): Stake $ALEX via LiALEX, powered by [LISA Protocol](https://www.lisalab.io/).
