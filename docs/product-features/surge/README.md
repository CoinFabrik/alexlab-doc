# âš¡ ALEX Surge

ALEX Surge is a round-based liquidity incentives program designed to reward participants, including liquidity providers (LPs) and voters who help distribute rewards.

By participating in Surge, LPs can stake their liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens) to earn additional $ALEX rewards, while voters can use their $ALEX or $LiALEX tokens to determine which liquidity pools receive a larger share of these rewards.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** LP tokens fluctuate in value based on pool activity and market conditions. Liquidity providers should consider factors like **impermanent loss** before staking in Surge.
{% endhint %}

Every Surge round consists of multiple stages, including **registration, voting & staking, and reward emissions**.

To join the current Surge campaign and start earning rewards, visit the [ALEX Surge App](https://app.alexlab.co/surge).

ðŸš¨ **Cut-off Dates in ALEX Surge**  

Cut-off dates define the deadlines for each phase in a Surge round:  
- **Registration Cut-off**: no new pools can join after this date.  
- **Voting Cut-off**: votes are locked, finalizing reward distribution.  
- **Staking Cut-off**: last opportunity to stake LP tokens.  

The current phase is always visible on the Surge interface.
