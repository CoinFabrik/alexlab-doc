# üßë‚Äçüè´ How to Participate in ALEX Surge

ALEX Surge is a **round-based liquidity incentives program** that rewards participants, including **liquidity providers (LPs) and voters**, for contributing to deeper and more robust liquidity pools on ALEX.

The Surge dashboard will display the different rounds of the program, such as Surge #16, Surge #17, etc.

Each Surge round follows these phases:
- **Registration**: projects can register their liquidity pools before the cut-off date.
- **Voting**: users vote to decide how $ALEX rewards will be distributed.
- **Staking**: liquidity providers stake LP tokens to earn additional rewards.
- **Surge Rewards Emission**: $ALEX rewards are distributed based on the votes and staking amounts.

The cut-off date is the deadline for registering liquidity pools in the current round. After this date, no new pools can enter, and the voting phase begins.
You can check the timeline at the top of the Surge page to track the current phase of the program.

## üó≥Ô∏è Voting for Emissions

During the voting phase, users can vote for their preferred liquidity pools to influence the distribution of $ALEX rewards.

### Step 1: Open the Surge Voting Section
After the registration cut-off, go to the [Surge App](https://app.alexlab.co/surge) and click `Vote for Emissions`.
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/surge/surge-vote.png" alt=""><figcaption>Voting interface</figcaption></figure>

### Step 2: Allocate Your Voting Power
Your voting power is based on your $ALEX and `$LiALEX` holdings.
- Choose how to distribute your votes among the available pools.
- Pools with more votes receive a higher share of the $ALEX rewards.

### Step 3: Submit Your Vote
Click **Cast Votes** to finalize your selection. 
**‚ö†Ô∏è You can only vote once per round per wallet**.
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/surge/surge-vote-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Allocating voting power</figcaption></figure>

‚ÑπÔ∏è Understanding the Voting Panel
- **Surge #XX Vote Ends In**: This shows how much time is left before the voting phase closes. Once the countdown reaches zero, no more votes can be cast for that round.
- **Current Votes**: This represents the total number of votes cast in this round so far. Every time a user votes, this number increases.
- **Emissions Per Surge**: this is the total amount of $ALEX rewards available for distribution in the current Surge round. The more votes a pool receives, the larger the share of these rewards it will get.
- **Voting Power Used**: this shows how much of your available voting power you have used. Each user gets voting power based on their holdings and staked tokens, and once they vote, their used amount appears here.

Pools that receive more votes will get a **higher share of the $ALEX rewards**.

## üîπ Staking LP Tokens
After voting, liquidity providers can stake LP tokens to earn additional rewards.

### Step 1: Open the Surge Staking Section
Go to the **Stake LP To Earn** section before the staking phase ends.

### Step 2: Select a Pool and Stake LP Tokens
Click `+ Stake LP` on the pool you want to stake in.
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/surge/surge-stake.png" alt=""><figcaption>Staking LP tokens in Surge pools</figcaption></figure>

### Step 3: Stake in Multiple Pools (Optional)
You can stake LP tokens in **multiple pools**, but each stake is separate.

### Step 4: Reward Distribution
- Rewards are distributed proportionally based on your staked LP tokens relative to the total staked amount in that pool.
- The more LP tokens you stake, the greater your share of the $ALEX rewards.

{% hint style="info" %}
üö® **Important Notes:** 
- The **ALEX Lab Foundation** also votes but **does not receive voter rewards**. 
- The voting **percentage** at the end of the staking phase determines how the **$ALEX rewards** are distributed. 
- You cannot withdraw staked LP tokens until the end of the Surge round.
{% endhint %}

## üí∞ Claim Your Rewards 

Once the voting and staking phase ends, the **reward emission phase** begins.

### Step 1: Wait for Rewards Distribution
- Once the staking period ends, the reward emission phase lasts approximately 27‚Äì28 days. 
- During this period, rewards are accumulated and become available for claiming.
- Your rewards depend on the total votes received by your pool and the amount of LP tokens you staked.

2. Click **Harvest all** to claim your LP tokens and earned $ALEX rewards.

- You can only claim rewards after the emission phase is complete.
- If you staked LP tokens, they will be automatically unstaked when you claim your rewards.
- A new Surge round starts after the rewards have been distributed.
{% endhint %}
