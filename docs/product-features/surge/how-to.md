# 💡 How to Participate in ALEX Surge

ALEX Surge is a **round-based liquidity incentives program** that rewards participants, including **liquidity providers (LPs) and voters**, for contributing to deeper and more robust liquidity pools on ALEX.  

This guide will walk you through the steps required to **register a pool, vote, stake LP tokens, and claim rewards**.

## ⚡ Step 1: Register a Pool  

If you are a project owner or community member, you can register a liquidity pool to participate in the Surge campaign.

### 📌 How to Register:
1. Go to the [ALEX Surge App](https://app.alexlab.co/surge) and click `Register for Surge`.

4. Promote your pool on **social media** by posting and engaging with tweets about your project.  
   - Use **@alexlabbtc** and **#ALEXSurge** in your tweets.  
   - Submit tweets via **Discord** or **Blocksurvey** to improve your ranking on the Social Leaderboard.

Once registered, your pool will appear on the **Social Leaderboard**, where it will be ranked based on **Twitter/X engagement metrics**.

## 🗳️ Step 2: Vote and Stake  

During the voting and staking phase, users can **vote for pools and stake their LP tokens**.

### 📌 How to Vote:
1. After the registration cut-off, go to the [Surge App](https://app.alexlab.co/surge) and click `Vote for Emissions`.
2. Choose how to **split your voting power** (determined by your **ALEX and LiALEX holdings**) among different pools.
3. **Submit your vote**. **You can only vote once per round per wallet**.

Pools that receive more votes will get a **higher share of the $ALEX rewards**.

### 📌 How to Stake LP Tokens:
1. Before the staking phase ends, go to the **Surge Staking section**.
2. Click `+ Stake LP` on the pool you want to stake in.
3. You can stake LP tokens in **multiple pools**.
4. Rewards will be distributed **proportionally** based on the amount staked.

🚨 **Important Notes:**  
- The **ALEX Lab Foundation** also votes but **does not receive voter rewards**.  
- The voting **percentage** at the end of the staking phase determines how the **$ALEX rewards** are distributed.

## 💰 Step 3: Claim Your Rewards  

Once the voting and staking phase ends, the **reward emission phase** begins.

### 📌 How to Claim Rewards:
1. **Wait for the rewards emission phase to complete** (usually **27–28 days**).
