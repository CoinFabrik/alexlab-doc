# ? FAQs

<details>
<summary>What is ALEX Surge?</summary>

**ALEX Surge** is a round-based liquidity incentives program that rewards participants for contributing to the ALEX decentralized exchange (DEX). It involves both **staking LP tokens** and **voting with ALEX/LiALEX tokens** to influence the distribution of rewards.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I participate in ALEX Surge?</summary>

You can participate in ALEX Surge in two ways:

1. **As a Liquidity Provider (LP)**: Provide liquidity to a pool and stake your LP tokens in the Surge pools to earn $ALEX rewards.
2. **As a Voter**: Use your ALEX or LiALEX tokens to vote for your preferred pools. Pools with more votes receive a larger share of the $ALEX rewards.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are LP tokens?</summary>

**LP tokens** are the tokens you receive when you provide liquidity to a trading pool on ALEX DEX. These tokens represent your share of the pool's assets. When you stake LP tokens in ALEX Surge, you earn a portion of the rewards allocated to that pool.

For more information, refer to the [Liquidity Providers](../liquidity-pools/) section.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How are rewards distributed in ALEX Surge?</summary>

Rewards are distributed based on the voting results and the amount of LP tokens staked:

1. **Voting Rewards**: Pools with more votes receive a higher percentage of the $ALEX rewards.
2. **Staking Rewards**: LPs earn $ALEX proportional to the amount of LP tokens staked in the pools.
3. **Voter Rewards**: Some pools donate additional rewards to attract voters. These rewards are distributed among the voters who supported the pool.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are Voter Rewards?</summary>

**Voter Rewards** are additional incentives donated by projects to encourage users to vote for their pools. Voters who support these pools receive a share of the donated rewards.

**Note:** Once donated, voter rewards **cannot be withdrawn**.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I vote for multiple pools?</summary>

Yes, you can split your voting power between multiple pools. However, **you can only vote once per round per wallet**. Make sure to allocate your votes strategically before submitting.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I don't harvest my rewards?</summary>

Your rewards will **accumulate over time**. It is not mandatory to harvest them immediately after the emission phase ends. When you withdraw (unstake) your LP tokens, any unclaimed rewards will be automatically included.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the Social Leaderboard?</summary>

The **Social Leaderboard** ranks pools based on their engagement on **Twitter/X**. Pools with higher engagement are more likely to receive votes from the **ALEX Lab Foundation**, which has significant voting power.

### How to improve your pool’s ranking:
- Use **@alexlabbtc** and **#ALEXSurge** in your posts.
- Submit your tweets via **Discord** or **Blocksurvey**.

### Engagement multipliers:
- **Likes**: 0.5X multiplier
- **Reposts/Quote Reposts**: 1.25X multiplier
- **Replies**: 1.5X multiplier

</details>

<details>
<summary>How does the ALEX Lab Foundation vote in Surge?</summary>

The **ALEX Lab Foundation** votes with **5,000,000 voting power** to help distribute rewards to pools. The foundation's votes are influenced by the **Social Leaderboard rankings**, favoring pools with higher community engagement.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** The foundation’s votes **do not receive any voter rewards**.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>
<summary>How long does the reward emission phase last?</summary>

The **reward emission phase** typically lasts **27–28 days**. During this period, rewards are distributed to the pools based on the voting results. After the emission phase ends, participants can **harvest their rewards** and **withdraw their staked LP tokens**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I register my pool multiple times?</summary>

Yes, pools can be **registered multiple times** before the cut-off date. Each registration allows you to **add more voter rewards** to attract additional votes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Once you donate voter rewards, they **cannot be revoked**.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I withdraw my LP tokens before the reward emission phase ends?</summary>

You **cannot withdraw** your staked LP tokens until the reward emission phase is complete. Once the phase ends, you can **unstake** your LP tokens and **claim any earned rewards**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is there any risk involved in staking LP tokens in Surge?</summary>

Yes, staking LP tokens in Surge involves the same risks as providing liquidity in any **AMM-based DEX**, including the risk of **Impermanent Loss**. This occurs when the value of the assets in the liquidity pool fluctuates significantly, potentially reducing the total value of your LP tokens.

For more details, check the [Impermanent Loss subsection](../liquidity-pools/key-concepts.md#impermanent-loss).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I participate in multiple Surge rounds?</summary>

Yes, after each Surge round concludes, the process **repeats monthly**. You can participate in as many rounds as you like by registering pools, voting, and staking LP tokens in each new round.
