# ❓ FAQs

<details>
<summary>What is ALEX Surge?</summary> 
    
**ALEX Surge** is a round-based liquidity incentives program designed to reward users who contribute to liquidity on the ALEX's decentralized exchange (DEX). Participants can vote with $ALEX or $LiALEX tokens to determine how $ALEX rewards are distributed among pools. Additionally, liquidity providers can stake their LP tokens to earn extra rewards.
Each Surge round distributes approximately 5,000,000 $ALEX based on the voting results, making it a unique opportunity for liquidity providers to earn additional rewards beyond standard pool fees.

<summary>How do I participate in ALEX Surge?</summary>

You can participate in ALEX Surge in several ways:

1. **As a Pool Registrant**: If you are a project owner or community member, you can register a liquidity pool to compete for $ALEX rewards. Once registered, users can vote for your pool, and liquidity providers can stake LP tokens in it. You may also donate voter rewards to attract more votes.
2. **As a Liquidity Provider (LP)**: Provide liquidity to a pool and stake your LP tokens in Surge to earn $ALEX rewards. The more LP tokens you stake, the larger your share of the rewards.
3. **As a Voter**: Use your $ALEX or $LiALEX tokens to vote for your preferred pools. Pools with more votes receive a larger share of the $ALEX rewards. Additionally, some pools offer **Voter Rewards**, which are extra incentives donated by the pool registrants to attract votes. By voting for these pools, you can earn a proportional share of the Voter Rewards allocated to that pool.
4. **By Promoting Your Pool on Social Media**: If you have a registered pool, you can increase its visibility by engaging with the ALEX community on **Twitter/X**. Pools with higher engagement may receive more votes from the ALEX Lab Foundation.

<summary>What are LP tokens?</summary>

**LP tokens** are the tokens you receive when you provide liquidity to a trading pool on the ALEX's decentralized exchange (DEX). These tokens represent your share of the pool's assets. In ALEX Surge, staking LP tokens allows liquidity providers to earn a share of the $ALEX rewards allocated to the pool, based on voting results and the total amount staked.

For more information, refer to the [Liquidity Providers](../liquidity-pools/key-concepts#liquidity-providers-lps) section.

<details>
<summary>How are rewards distributed in ALEX Surge?</summary>

Each Surge round distributes a fixed amount of $ALEX rewards among the participating pools based on the voting results:

1. **Voting Rewards**: The total $ALEX emissions for the round are allocated to pools proportionally to the votes received. Pools with more votes get a larger share of the rewards.
2. **Staking Rewards**: Within each pool, the allocated $ALEX rewards are distributed among liquidity providers based on their staked LP tokens.
3. **Voter Rewards**: Some pools donate additional rewards to attract voters. These rewards are distributed proportionally to those who voted for that pool.

<details>
<summary>What are Voter Rewards?</summary>

**Voter Rewards** are additional incentives that projects voluntarily donate to attract votes for their liquidity pools. If a voter supports a pool that has donated voter rewards, they will receive a proportional share of those rewards.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Once donated, voter rewards **cannot be revoked or withdrawn**.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I vote for multiple pools?</summary>

Yes, you can distribute your voting power across multiple pools when voting. However, you can only submit your vote once per round per wallet, meaning you cannot modify or add votes later. Make sure to allocate your votes strategically before confirming.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I don't harvest my rewards?</summary>

Your rewards will accumulate over time, and you are not required to harvest them immediately after the emission phase ends. If you staked LP tokens, any unclaimed rewards will be automatically harvested when you unstake your LP tokens.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the Social Leaderboard?</summary>

The Social Leaderboard ranks pools based on their engagement on Twitter/X. Pools with higher engagement have a better chance of receiving votes from the ALEX Lab Foundation, which holds significant voting power.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How does the ALEX Lab Foundation vote in Surge?</summary>

The **ALEX Lab Foundation** votes with **5,000,000 voting power** to help distribute rewards to pools. The foundation's votes are influenced by the **Social Leaderboard rankings**, favoring pools with higher community engagement.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** The foundation’s votes **do not receive any voter rewards**.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>
<summary>How long does the reward emission phase last?</summary>

The **reward emission phase** typically lasts **27–28 days**. During this period, rewards are distributed to the pools based on the voting results. After the emission phase ends, participants can **harvest their rewards** and **withdraw their staked LP tokens**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I register my pool multiple times?</summary>

Yes, pools can be **registered multiple times** before the cut-off date. Each registration allows you to **add more voter rewards** to attract additional votes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Once you donate voter rewards, they **cannot be revoked**.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I withdraw my LP tokens before the reward emission phase ends?</summary>

You **cannot withdraw** your staked LP tokens until the reward emission phase is complete. Once the phase ends, you can **unstake** your LP tokens and **claim any earned rewards**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚠️ Is there any risk involved in staking LP tokens in Surge?</summary>

Yes, staking LP tokens in Surge involves the same risks as providing liquidity in any **AMM-based DEX**, including the risk of **Impermanent Loss**. This occurs when the value of the assets in the liquidity pool fluctuates significantly, potentially reducing the total value of your LP tokens.

For more details, check the [Impermanent Loss subsection](../liquidity-pools/key-concepts.md#impermanent-loss).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I participate in multiple Surge rounds?</summary>

Yes, after each Surge round concludes, the process **repeats monthly**. You can participate in as many rounds as you like by registering pools, voting, and staking LP tokens in each new round.
