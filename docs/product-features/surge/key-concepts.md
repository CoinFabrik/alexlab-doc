# üí° Key Concepts

## What is ALEX Surge?

**ALEX Surge** is a **liquidity incentives program** that rewards participants for their contributions to the ALEX decentralized exchange (DEX). It is designed to encourage deeper and more robust liquidity pools and active community engagement through a combination of **staking** and **voting** mechanisms.

Participants can be:
- **Liquidity Providers (LPs)** who stake LP tokens in Surge pools to earn rewards.
- **Voters** who use their ALEX or LiALEX tokens to influence how rewards are distributed among the pools.

## What are LP Tokens? üíß

**LP tokens** are tokens you receive when you provide funds to a **liquidity pool**. They represent your share of the pool‚Äôs assets and allow you to earn rewards from trading fees and incentive programs like **ALEX Surge**.

When you stake LP tokens in ALEX Surge:
- You **lock** your LP tokens in the Surge pools for the duration of the campaign.
- You earn **$ALEX rewards** proportional to the amount of LP tokens you‚Äôve staked.

For a deeper understanding of these concepts, check out the [Liquidity Providers](../liquidity-pools/) section of the docs.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Providing liquidity involves the risk of **Impermanent Loss**. This occurs when the value of the assets in a liquidity pool fluctuates, potentially affecting the total value of your LP tokens. Learn more in the [Impermanent Loss subsection](../liquidity-pools/key-concepts.md#impermanent-loss).

## Voting Mechanisms in ALEX Surge üó≥Ô∏è

Voting is a key component of ALEX Surge. It allows participants to influence how **$ALEX rewards** are distributed across different liquidity pools.

### How Does Voting Work?
- Users vote using their **ALEX** or **LiALEX** tokens.
- Voting power can be split between multiple pools.
- The **more votes** a pool receives, the **greater share of rewards** it earns.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** The **ALEX Lab Foundation** has a significant voting power (5,000,000), but its votes are **excluded from receiving voter rewards**.
{% endhint %}

### What Are Voter Rewards?
Some pools offer **voter rewards** as incentives to attract more votes. These are additional rewards donated by the pool's project or community.

- **Once donated, voter rewards cannot be withdrawn.**
- Voters who support pools with voter rewards will share these extra incentives.

## The Social Leaderboard üìà

The **Social Leaderboard** is a unique feature of ALEX Surge that rewards community engagement. Projects can boost their chances of receiving votes by promoting their pools on social media.

### How Does the Social Leaderboard Work?
- Projects post about their pools on **Twitter/X** using **@alexlabbtc** and **#ALEXSurge**.
- Engagement metrics (likes, reposts, replies) determine their ranking.
- Higher-ranking projects receive **more votes from the ALEX Lab Foundation**.

### Social Engagement Metrics:
- **Likes**: 0.5X multiplier
- **Reposts/Quote Reposts**: 1.25X multiplier
- **Replies**: 1.5X multiplier

{% hint style="info" %}
To be included in the leaderboard, projects must submit their tweets via **Discord** or **Blocksurvey**.
{% endhint %}

## Reward Distribution in ALEX Surge üí∞

Rewards in ALEX Surge are distributed based on **voting results** and **LP staking**.

### Types of Rewards:
1. **$ALEX Emissions**: Distributed to pools based on the percentage of votes received.
2. **Voter Rewards**: Donated by projects to incentivize voters.
3. **Staking Rewards**: LPs receive $ALEX proportional to the amount of LP tokens they staked in Surge pools.

### Reward Emission Period:
- The reward emission phase typically lasts **27‚Äì28 days**.
- After the emission period ends, participants can **harvest** their rewards and **withdraw** their staked LP tokens.

## Risks and Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Impermanent Loss:
Providing liquidity and staking LP tokens comes with the risk of **impermanent loss**, where fluctuations in asset prices can reduce the value of your staked tokens. This risk is inherent in all liquidity provision activities on AMM-based DEXs like ALEX.

### Finality of Voter Rewards:
Once **voter rewards** are donated by projects, they **cannot be withdrawn**. This ensures transparency and fairness but requires careful consideration before contributing.
