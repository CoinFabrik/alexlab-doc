# üêã Liquidity Pools

ALEX supports **two types of liquidity pools**:  
‚Üí the **traditional AMM model**, and  
‚Üí the new **DAMM (Discrete Automated Market Maker)**.

Both options let you earn fees by providing liquidity ‚Äî but they differ in how your capital is used:

- **AMM** distributes your liquidity evenly across the full price range.  
  It‚Äôs simple and passive ‚Äî ideal for users who prefer a ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù strategy.

- **DAMM** lets you concentrate your liquidity in specific price ranges, called *ticks*.  
  It‚Äôs more advanced ‚Äî perfect for users seeking greater efficiency and control.
