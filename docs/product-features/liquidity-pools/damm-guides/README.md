# ðŸŽ¯ DAMM Liquidity Guides

The DAMM (Discrete Automated Market Maker) model lets you provide liquidity within **specific price ranges**, called *bins*.

Unlike traditional AMMs, your capital isnâ€™t spread across the entire price curve. Instead, you choose where to concentrate it, giving you **more control** and potentially **higher fee earnings**, especially when trades occur in your selected price zones.

However, keep in mind:
- You only earn fees when the **market price is inside your active bin(s)**.
- If the price moves outside that range, your liquidity becomes **inactive** until the price returns.

This guide walks you through the key steps to **add** and **remove** liquidity using the DAMM strategy.
