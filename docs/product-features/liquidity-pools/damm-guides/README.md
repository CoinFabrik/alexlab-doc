# ðŸŽ¯ DAMM Liquidity Guides

The DAMM (Discrete Automated Market Maker) model allows you to focus your liquidity in specific price ranges, called *bins* or *ticks*.

This strategy gives you more control and can offer better capital efficiency â€” but it requires choosing which price zones you want to support.

Youâ€™ll earn trading fees only when swaps happen inside the bins you selected. Your position remains inactive (and doesn't earn fees) when the market price moves outside your selected range.
