# ðŸ’§ AMM Liquidity Guides

The traditional AMM model on ALEX allows you to add liquidity across the entire price range of a token pair.

This approach is simple and passive â€” a good fit if you want to earn trading fees without worrying about market price movements.

Once your liquidity is added, youâ€™ll receive LP tokens representing your share of the pool. You can remove your liquidity at any time to redeem your tokens and your share of the earned fees.
