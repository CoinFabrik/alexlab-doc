# ðŸ’§ AMM Liquidity Guides

The traditional AMM (Automated Market Maker) model on ALEX spreads your liquidity **evenly across the full price curve** of a token pair.

This is a **simple and passive** strategy â€” ideal if you want to earn trading fees without selecting price ranges or actively managing your position.

Once you provide liquidity:
- You receive **LP tokens** that represent your share of the pool.
- Your share grows automatically as trading fees are collected.
- You can remove your liquidity at any time to redeem your tokens and earned rewards.

This guide will walk you through the steps to **add** and **remove** liquidity using the AMM model.
