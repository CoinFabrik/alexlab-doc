The procedure will be different depending on the marketplace you choose to buy ALEX tokens. 

## Using ALEX Lab Platform

If you decide to use the [ALEX Lab](https://app.alexlab.co/swap) platform (the last option on the list), you can follow these steps:

1. First, connect your wallet. You can follow this step-by-step guide:
