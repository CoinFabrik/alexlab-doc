# $USDA

Arkadiko is a unique project for ALEX to collaborate with, given that they are very well known in the Stacks community and were the first DeFi platform to launch on Stacks.

### What is Arkadiko :

Arkadiko is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can collateralize their STX tokens and borrow a stablecoin called USDA. This enables you to gain increased liquidity in the form of a soft-pegged US Dollar stablecoin, while maintaining original asset exposure. Your STX tokens generate a yield, which pays back the USDA loan automatically over time. At current yields, it takes about 3 years to pay back your loan completely. No need to worry about monthly payments.

### What is $USDA:

The Arkadiko protocol trustlessly provides stable loans backed by Stacks Tokens (STX), known as USDA. In order to mint USDA, you need to over-collateralize Stacks (STX) tokens into an Arkadiko Stacks Vault. In other words, USDA is a stablecoin, existing to maintain relative price stability in volatile markets.

#### **Stablecoin Risk Parameters**

* Debt Ceiling: A Debt Ceiling is the maximum amount of debt that can be created by a single collateral type. Arkadiko Governance assigns every collateral type a Debt Ceiling, which is used to ensure sufficient diversification of the Arkadiko Protocol collateral portfolio. Once a collateral type has reached its Debt Ceiling, it becomes impossible to create more debt unless some existing users pay back all or a portion of their Reserve debt.
* Stability Fee: The Stability Fee is an annual percentage yield calculated on top of how much USDA has been generated against a Reserve's collateral. The fee is paid in $STX and then sent into the Arkadiko Buffer.
* Liquidation Ratio: A low Liquidation Ratio means Arkadiko Governance expects low price volatility of the collateral; a high Liquidation Ratio means high volatility is expected.
* Liquidation Penalty: The Liquidation Penalty is a fee added to a Reserve's total outstanding generated USDA when a Liquidation occurs. The Liquidation Penalty is used to encourage USDA owners to keep appropriate collateral levels.

### Tokenomics

There is no formal Tokenomics paper.

Elements of their tokenomics are available throughout their docs page, particular in the “DIKO” and “Incentive and Rewards” sections:
