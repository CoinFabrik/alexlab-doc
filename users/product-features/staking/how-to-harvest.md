# :moneybag: Harvesting Rewards (Manual Staking)

Once your first staking cycle ends, you will be able to start harvesting your rewards. This section explains how to transfer your rewards to your wallet. To proceed to Liquid Staking with LiALEX, refer to the [Auto-Stake section](how-to.md#auto-stake-liquid-staking).

### Step 1: Check My Staking

As when staking, go to the [Stake page](https://app.alexlab.co/stake), or, alternatively, click on the navbar's `Earn` -> `Stake` tab from the [ALEX Lab homepage](https://app.alexlab.co).

Once you're on the Stake page, you'll find the **My Staking** panel, which displays your current stake. 

### Step 2: Harvest Your Principal and Your Rewards

If a cycle has ended and you can claim rewards, you will see your \$ALEX and APower on the `Harvest` button. If you have no rewards to claim yet, `Harvest` will be greyed out. The button will also display the amount of $ALEX and APower that are available for harvesting.

Bear in mind that, if your staking period has ended, harvesting will also transfer your **Principal** (your staked $ALEX), to your wallet. It is not possible to collect only a portion of your principal or your rewards.

Click on the `Harvest` button to claim your rewards.

### Step 3: Confirm Harvest

A confirmation panel will appear where you can double check the amount. If everything looks correct, click `Confirm`.

#### Confirm Harvest

* **Principal:** This is the amount of staked \$ALEX that is no longer locked-up and can be transferred to your wallet. If you've staked 100 ALEX tokens for 4 cycles, and only the first cycle has ended, you will be able to harvest your rewards for that cycle while staked $ALEX remain locked-up for 3 more cycles. Hence, the principal would be 0 for this case. However, after the 4th cycle, the principal would be 100. &#x20;
* **Reward:** The amount of ALEX tokens and APower you can claim as a reward for staking your $ALEX tokens. If you don't harvest your rewards, they will continue to accumulate.
* **Total Claim:** The sum of your principal and rewards, in $ALEX and APower. This is the amount that will be transferred to your wallet.


### Step 4: Confirm Transaction

After clicking `Confirm`, you will need to confirm the transaction in your wallet. 

Here, your Stacks wallet is interacting with the ALEX smart contract and is asking you for approval. Scroll through the wallet transaction window, review it and confirm the transaction. By doing this, you are allowing the wallet to sign and broadcast the transaction.

### Step 5: Check Transaction Status

Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the network. 

Transferring your rewards and staked tokens could take between 20-40 minutes, but once the transaction is confirmed on the ALEX network, you will be able to see your rewards in your wallet.

Recommended to track transaction status:

* Turn on [Telegram notifications](https://t.me/stacks\_tx\_notification\_bot), you will get notified when the transaction is confirmed.
* Search for the transaction on the [ALEX Explorer](https://app.alexlab.co/explorer).
* Check your address activity on the wallet.
