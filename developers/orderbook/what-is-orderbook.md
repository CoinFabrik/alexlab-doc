<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Orderbook is ALEX's scaling solution layer that brings **instant trade confirmation** to the security of Bitcoin.

Orderbook uses a hybrid on-chain/off-chain design, whereby a commitment to buy or sell certain asset is communicated in a cryptographically signed message, which is then matched by an off-chain matching engine before settling on-chain.

Orderbook is designed such that many types of market exchanges, not only a traditional CLOB but also an NFT marketplace or social trading, can be built on top.

Orderbook therefore addresses a key user experience issue our community has on Stocks - that the trade confirmation requires waiting of 10-15 minutes (along with Bitcoin block confirmation).

### Gas-free orders
