# Welcome to ALEX Developer Docs

**ALEX** is building the financial infrastructure on Bitcoin by combining Bitcoin L1 with Stacks L2 to unlock smart contract capabilities, DeFi primitives, and permissionless financial tools for Bitcoin users.

Our architecture allows decentralized trading, cross-chain swaps, yield generation, and more — all secured by Bitcoin and powered by Stacks. With Ordinals, BRC-20s, and Layer 2 innovation accelerating, ALEX is shaping the future of Bitcoin DeFi.
