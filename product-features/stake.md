# ⚓ Stake

ALEX staking involves “locking up” your $ALEX token on the platform for an amount of time (”rewards cycles”) in exchange for earning protocol rewards.&#x20;

You can think of $ALEX staking as depositing money into an interest-earning account. The longer you keep the money in the account the more interest you earn. Similarly, the longer you stake $ALEX the more rewards you earn.

ALEX provides manual(Customized) ALEX Staking.&#x20;

Lisa Protocol([https://www.lisalab.io/](https://www.lisalab.io/)) is now providing liquid staking for ALEX Staking ($LiALEX)&#x20;

The protocol rewards are provided in the form of more $ALEX as well as [$APower](https://medium.com/alexgobtc/what-is-alex-staking-power-and-how-do-i-use-it-1b3de3797fa2) which is only available to stakers to be used in the ALEX launchpad.
