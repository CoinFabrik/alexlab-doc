# 🧑‍🌾 Self-Service Farming

## Self-Service Farming Procedure

Step 1: Select a pool that you have created. (Note: Only the pool creator can use Self-Service Farming to add farming.)

Step 2: Deposit the total farming reward to your selected pool. (Note: Self-Service Farming only allows token Y to be added as the farming reward.) &#x20;

Step 3: Choose the Reward Cycle Length. (This will determine the total length of farming that you've added, which will be distributed to farming users.)&#x20;

The Self-Service Farming won't commence immediately after your creation transaction is confirmed.

The farming added will automatically begin at the cycle shown on the user interface when you add the farming reward on the Self-Service Farming page.
