# ðŸŒ¾ Farming

By farming (staking/locking up) LP tokens, in addition to receiving liquidity pool transactions fees, you also earn $ALEX and APower rewards.

Unlike $ALEX Staking, Farms require you to stake **two tokens** to get LP Tokens, which you then stake in the Farm to earn rewards. This lets you earn ALEX while still keeping a position in your other tokens!

### Getting prepared

Yield farming just takes a few easy steps get set up.

Youâ€™re first going to need some "LP Tokens" to stake in a yield farm. Farms can only accept their native LP Token, meaning the STX/ALEX Farm will only accept STX/ALEX-50-50 LP Tokens.

To acquire STX/ALEX-50-50 LP Tokens, you must first provide liquidity to the STX/ALEX liquidity pool.

You could visit [Farm\&Harvest](../how-to/farm-and-harvest.md) in HOW TO section for details.
